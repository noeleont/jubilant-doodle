proposes a set of techniques to develop correctly\nrounded math libraries for 32-bit float and posit types. It\nenhances our RLibm approach that frames the problem of\ngenerating correctly rounded libraries as a linear programming problem in the context of 16-bit types to scale to 32-bit\ntypes. Specifically, this paper proposes new algorithms to\n(1) generate polynomials that produce correctly rounded\noutputs for all inputs using counterexample guided polynomial generation, (2) generate efficient piecewise polynomials\nwith bit-pattern based domain splitting, and (3) deduce the\namount of freedom available to produce correct results when\nrange reduction involves multiple elementary functions. The\nresultant math library for the 32-bit float type is faster than\nstate-of-the-art math libraries while producing the correct\noutput for all inputs. We have also developed a set of correctly rounded elementary functions for 32-bit posits.‚Äù\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jyhfpy/high_performance_correctly_rounded_math","submitter_user":{"username":"nickpsecurity","created_at":"2016-07-28T14:11:08.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Previously:\r\n\r\nWhite nerd who grew up in mostly-poor environments with country rednecks, black gangstas, and few opportunities. Well-off just long enough to know how skewed system was. Became a survalist, engineer, researcher, scientist, reformer, and civil rights activist. \r\n\r\nI focused on tech and practices to secure systems and boost human potential. In security, my specialty was high-assurance security to defend against nation-state attackers (esp inventing/evaluating techniques). That's systems provably invulnerable to known classes of attack, limiting damage of unknown classes, recovering to safe state after any attack, and optionally fault-tolerant techniques to keep them at five 9's reliability.\r\n\r\nCurrently (officially June 2020):\r\n\r\nCalled by, returned to, and growing in the Lord Jesus Christ. Since then, I've experienced personal transformation, miracles, and more. 2020 went from a nightmare to an adventure! It all started with the promises of the Word of God (Bible).\r\n\r\nThe Word of God impacted over a billion people of all types in more than 196 countries. Tells us about who God is, us, our problems, His solution, and much wisdom. Takes a *long* time to read, though. \r\n\r\nFor that reason, I put up a [site](https://www.heswithjesus.com) that condenses it to minutes, has a page with evidence it's true, my story, and my old sins. The latter two show Jesus can reach anyone no matter their past or current challenges. My sins up on site that only looses money is proof I'm honest about that. There's no psychological or scientific explanation for much of what's happened: only God could do it.
